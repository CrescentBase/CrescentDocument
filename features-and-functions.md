## Gasless

Gasless is crucial to the mass adoption of Web3.

As a smart contract wallet that supports EIP 4337 protocol, Paymaster will pay gas for users to achieve a gasless experience when users start a transaction.&#x20;

Paymaster not only supports payment in native tokens for gas but also supports other tokens or payments such as NFT.&#x20;

We provide a part of the basic paymaster template, which developers can deploy and customize the following parameters:

* The type of tokens to pay.
* Set up a contract whitelist, when the user interacts with the contract in whitelist, the gas will be paid for the user automatically.
* Customize gas policy, provide gas discounts for new users, etc.

## Multi-chain support

For now, we support the following chains:

* Ethereum
* Arbitrum
* BSC
* Polygon&#x20;
